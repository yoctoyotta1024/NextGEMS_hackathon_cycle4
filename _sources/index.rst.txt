.. note::
   Please consider that this project is under active development
   and our documentation is a work in progress.

   This documentation is built from the latest code in the main branch of the repository.
   It does not necessarily reflect a released version, and there may be short-commings when compared
   to the on-going code development. If you have queries related to
   this or if there is anything you wish to report please please :ref:`contact us! <contact>`.

To (locally) reproduce this project, simply clone the repository. You will need to run
``pre-commit install`` but other than that all the necessary packages for you to run & have fun
should work given the environment.yml... If not, please raise an issue on the GitHub repository.
