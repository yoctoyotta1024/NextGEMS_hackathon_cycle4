Our Docs
========

We use Sphinx to build documentation for this project in .html files.

You can build the documentation locally e.g. by

.. code-block:: console

  $ cd ./docs && mkdir build && make html

which you can then view in your preferred browser e.g.

.. code-block:: console

  $ open build/html/index.html
